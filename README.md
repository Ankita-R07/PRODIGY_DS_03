# Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier for Product Purchase Prediction

## Objective
Develop a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Bank Marketing Dataset  
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Link**: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Preprocessed data (handled missing values and categorical variables).
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier.
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6. Visualized the decision tree and important features.

## Key Outcomes
- Built an interpretable classification model.
- Gained insights into key factors influencing customer purchase decisions.
- Demonstrated the application of supervised learning in marketing analytics.
